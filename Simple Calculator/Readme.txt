When you run Flex and Bison to generate code for a lexical analyzer and parser, several files are created in the process. Here's a summary of what each tool generates:

Files Generated by Flex (flex)

lex.yy.c

This is the C source file generated by Flex from the .l file. It contains the code for the lexical analyzer based on your lexer rules.

Files Generated by Bison (bison)

Calculator.tab.c

This C source file contains the parser code generated by Bison from the .y file. It implements the parser based on your grammar rules.

Calculator.tab.h

This header file contains definitions and declarations needed for communication between the lexer (lex.yy.c) and parser (Calculator.tab.c). It includes definitions for tokens, data types, and external variables.

Calculator.tab.c (updated file)

If you run Bison with the -d option, it updates this file with definitions from the .y file. It also creates or updates Calculator.tab.h.



Compilation and Linking Process
Generate the Scanner (Flex):

bash
Copy code
flex Calculator.l
Generate the Parser (Bison):

bash
Copy code
bison -d Calculator.y
Compile and Link:

bash
Copy code
gcc lex.yy.c Calculator.tab.c -o Calculator.exe -lm
In this process:

lex.yy.c and Calculator.tab.c are compiled to object files.
Object files are linked to create the final executable (e.g., Calculator.exe).

Summary:

Bison: Generates the parser code and header files (like Calculator.tab.h) from a Bison grammar file (Calculator.y).
Flex: Generates lexical analyzer code from a Flex source file (Calculator.l).
Precompiled Header: Files like Calculator.tab.h.gch are precompiled versions of headers. They speed up compilation by avoiding the need to recompile headers that haven't changed.
In general, you don't need to manually interact with these filesâ€”they are managed by the build system and the compiler. If you encounter issues or need to clean your build, you might remove these files to force a full rebuild.
